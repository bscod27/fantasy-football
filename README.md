# fantasy-football

Supervised machine learning workflow for fantasy football draft selections written in R. 40+ years of data pulled from `Kaggle` and saved within the `data` folder. 

R scripts are found in the `scripts` folder. Users must save the data in hard drive and change the directory in the script to run models. 

Next version will implement web scraping to enable automatic data pulls from `Kaggle`.
